# Speedy Eggbert 2 Source Code Decomp

## Introduction
This is decompiled source code of Speedy Eggbert 2.

This repository is based on the following works:
 - https://github.com/jummy0/sb2-decomp

As of now (5/17/24), there hasn't been any source code found for SE2. So we are using the released (original) source code from Planet Blupi to compare code and help us with the proccess.
